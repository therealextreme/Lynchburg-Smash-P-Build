# Lynchburg-Smash-P-Build
This build is being worked on by extreme & PyroPM. 

(If you are in Lynchburg and know how to mod PM you are welcome to contribute)
# Overview
This build is designed to be used at Lynchburg Smash P+ tournaments. As such, this build makes no gameplay changes and only changes/adds cosmetics. So menus, costumes and stages are likely the only things subject to any changes

Since the build currently has very few features, ive only included the few files that I've released for the build instead of a download for a fully fledged P+ build. Once ive added enough files or add a file that is too compliciated for most people to install, I will setup a download for a full build
